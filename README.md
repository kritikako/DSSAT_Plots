# DSSAT_File Preparation_Results Extraction
Howdy!

This repository contains codes in different languages (VBA, R, MATLAB), reading DSSAT input/output files and creating plots.

I have excel VBA and matlab code for running DSSAT through command line that I intend to upload after soft-coding them.

Soon, I will be uploading R/ R markdown codes to read and plot DSSAt ouput.
