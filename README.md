# DSSAT_File Preparation_Results Extraction
Howdy!

This repository contains codes in different languages (VBA, R, MATLAB) for writing/reading DSSAT input/output files.

Most of the codes here are VBA codes and specific to my project. You may not be able to use them directly.

I would be happy to help you with reading/writing/running multiple DSSAT files programmatically.
